# Shenanigans with Life

Hey! This is my attempt at organizing my thoughts as I enter my Final year of my Undergraduate studies at IIT Bombay. I have been confused for sometime with regards to the direction of my career and my choices that lie ahead. I hope to find some clarity and recluse within these blog posts. 

More posts on Robotics, Careers related realizations that happen eventually, and Life in general in the tech domain coming up!
