I am a third year undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, pursuing a B.Tech in Aerospace engineering. I love being around Robots, especially ones that fly. Other than that, I enjoy creating things with my own hands - pottery, knitting and origami being the things I have tried so far.
Science fiction books and movies interest me a lot, along with Paneer cuisines.
