# My Life Until Now

## Early Life
I'd been a pretty normal student up until my 12th grade. Studies came about easily, and so I spent my time chilling and doing random stuff at my boarding school (Talking about my school is an entirely different blog post. It was amazing. Do check it out [here](https://rishigurukulam.org/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw0umSBhDrARIsAH7FCofDtKymBoLMDFbOZtsEH3mKFbIZ_aZKahbQat9rTEtzoHi4WJ55eqQaAs9fEALw_wcB)).

Anyways, due to a few insecurities and a few bullies, I developed a severe social anxiety of sorts, coupled with a people pleasing tendency, so that people would like me and be my friends. Before this, my early childhood was spent without a lot of friends, and so this was important to me at the time. During this time, I did make a lot of good friends that have remained very close to me since. 

## High School days
After my chill days at Middle school, I started preparing for the JEE competitive exams with the goal of getting into a nice "Astrophysics college". This was only based off of my vague interest in Space Research and Aerospace vehicles. It was during these years that a lot of my beliefs and values changed. I spent 2 years in Surat, going to a Coaching centre everyday for 8-12 hours and studying away to crack JEE. 
My limits of focusing on things increased dramatically as I blocked out all distractions and focused on only one thing in my life. A lot of desires to explore many options grew inside me, but all I did was note them down for my future self to pursue, and continued studying. 

## Freshman Year
As soon my JEE results were out and I found out I would be able to get into IIT Bombay Aerospace Engineering, I was esctatic. I spent a majority of my time of the first few months watching movies, playing games and exploring a lot of different things. Started a venture where I would connect Tutors with students in the city and took a commission for the same from them, Learnt Drums and participated in a modelling shoot. A whole range of different things. 
A chance encounter with a senior introduced me to a Student Technical Team called [UMIC](https://umiciitb.com/) - which would change my life and its direction completely. It was a student technical team building Autonomous Drones and Self driving cars. 
I found it extremely interesting and decided to join the team. It proved to be the best decision of my life. 

## Sophomore Year
This was the hardest and the most hectic year of my life yet. I went all in with UMIC, and participated in around 4 Drone competitions - National and International, winning almost all of them. But managing this along with the increased academic load took its toll on me - physically and mentally. Both slowly declined - a product of my neglect. Despite this, I grew the most during this year. It transformed me technically, as well as emotionally. I stretched my limits and became much more resilient and calm. External things affected me to lesser extent now. This was in part due to a friend of mine discussing Stoicism with me regularly, giving me interesting thoughts and ideals to ponder upon. 
Other than that, I started thinking more maturely, taking up more responsiblities in the Non Technical domain of the team as well. Throughout this year, I started making up my mind about Robotics as my career path. I loved what I did in the team, and it gave me immense satisfaction. This was the most logical choice for me back then. It still is. 

## Third year


<!--
## Basic setup

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. `.md` is the file extension for markdown files.

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "*level 1 heading*" in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line `## File names` above.

## Basic formatting

You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Here's a footnote [^1]. Here's a horizontal rule:

---

## Lists

Here's a list:

- item 1
- item 2

And a numbered list:

1. item 1
1. item 2

## Boxes and stuff

> This is a quotation

{% include alert.html text="You can include alert boxes" %}

...and...

{% include info.html text="You can include info boxes" %}

## Images

![](/images/logo.png "fast.ai's logo")

## Code

General preformatted text:

    # Do a thing
    do_thing()

Python code and output:

```python
# Prints '2'
print(1+1)
```

    2

## Tables

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|-|-|
| A thing | Another thing |

## Footnotes
